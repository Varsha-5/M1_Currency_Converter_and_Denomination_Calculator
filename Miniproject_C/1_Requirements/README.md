# CURRENCY EXCHANGE AND DENOMINATION CALCULATOR
## OBJECTIVE:
* To create a project on C which can help in identifying the type of currency,origin of that currency and Indian equvalent of that particular currency.
* To compare two different currencies.
* To create a currency exchanger.
* To produce the denomination of a particular amount.
### INDRODUCTION:
 * The currency exchange and denomination calculator is a project which will be useful in many scenarios.
 * In this project,10 countries are chosen as a base and  four functions are  applied to all such 10 countries.
 * The ten countries chosen were 1.Dollar   2.Euro  3. Yen 4.Riyal  5.pound  6.Tukka 7.Peso   8.Rubble  9.Baht 10.Dong.
 * By using this project,
     * The user will be able to explore a currency
     * The user will be able to compare two different currencies.
     * The user will be able to perform a currency exchange.
     * The user will be able to produce denominations for a given amount.
